              My name is Godwin Ebikwo, I was born and raised in a country
              called Nigeria. Although I studied computer science and software
              entrepreneurship at the University of Buckingham, I cannot FIX
              your printer, but I can design and develop your website though. I
              worked as an intern at the BEIU hub Buckingham before returning to
              Nigeria. I love music, modern art, and football. I spend my free
              time watching Ted-X riddles on youtube but still cannot understand
              them. I also try to make things work and for the right amount of
              money, I will learn anything. Shameless plug but check out my
              playlist on spotify ➣➣➣
